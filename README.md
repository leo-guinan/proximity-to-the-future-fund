## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run sensitivity analysis
python3 src/sensitivity_analysis.py
```

## Overview

The Proximity to the Future Fund is a recursive economic architecture that unites the roles of **hedge fund, accelerator, and startup** within a single bounded entity known as a **Pod**. Its purpose is to systematically increase a network's *proximity to the future*—the measurable ability to perceive, model, and act upon change faster than others without introducing instability.

### Core Components

1. **Proximity Fund**: Pod-based temporal engines that compound foresight
2. **$PROX Token**: Predictable crypto-economic model with trust-weighted mechanics
3. **Mathlete Chain**: Trust-weighted ledger for verified understanding

## Key Concepts

### Proximity to the Future
The measurable ability to perceive, model, and act upon change faster than others without introducing instability. Defined as the **inverse of verification latency**.

### Pod
A small, self-contained portfolio (3–6 startups) with a shared operational core and pooled research capital. Functions as a *time arbitrage machine* and *collective intelligence cell*.

### Temporal Alpha
Performance beyond *collective time expectation*—how much earlier a system realizes the same insight relative to others.

### Time Violence
Operational entropy caused by misalignment or over-acceleration. Measured as: \(TV_t = \gamma_t T_t (1 - \tau_t)\)

---

## Ecosystem Architecture

### Three Integrated Layers

1. **Research Layer (Mathlete Chain)**
   - Verifies claims and reduces uncertainty
   - Mathlete Tokens (MLT) represent research under verification
   - Validators earn recognition weight through successful replications

2. **Capital Layer (Proximity Fund)**
   - Allocates capital based on verified foresight
   - Pods function as temporal engines (hedge fund + accelerator + startup)
   - Temporal Alpha measures performance beyond collective time expectation

3. **Token Layer ($PROX)**
   - Rewards network coherence and verified understanding
   - Predictable tokenomics derived from observable state variables
   - Automatic minting based on foresight efficiency
   - Automatic burning based on time violence

## Mathematical Framework

All formulations are documented in [Appendix A](docs/appendices/APPENDIX_A_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md):

- **A1**: Foresight Efficiency
- **A2**: Recursive Compounding Function
- **A3**: Trust-Leverage Relationship
- **A4**: Network Relativity Principle
- **A5**: Total Compounded Understanding
- **A6-A10**: Additional formulations

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Validate the Model

```bash
python3 src/prove_model.py
```

This runs all validation tests and generates:
- Model validation results
- Pod simulation visualizations
- Two-Pod comparison (A4 Network Relativity)

### 2. Simulate Token Economics

```bash
python3 src/prox_token_simulation.py
```

Demonstrates $PROX token mechanics:
- Supply evolution
- Minting and burning dynamics
- Staking rewards
- Predictability analysis

### 3. Run Sensitivity Analysis

```bash
python3 src/sensitivity_analysis.py
```

Sweeps parameters and quantifies:
- Parameter impact on key metrics
- A4 causal lift (ablation study)
- Optimal parameter combinations

### 4. Simulate Mathlete Token Lifecycle

```bash
python3 src/mathlete_lifecycle_simulation.py
```

Shows how a research claim evolves:
- Trust compounding over epochs
- Uncertainty reduction
- Time violence decline
- Compounded understanding growth

## Results

All simulation results are saved in `results/`:

- **figures/**: Visualization plots (PNG)
- **data/**: Time series data (CSV)

Key results:
- Time-violence reduction: **99.88%** over 50 cycles
- TV trend: **Negative (improving)**
- Token supply: Self-regulating based on network state
- A4 causal lift: Quantified improvement from Network Relativity
